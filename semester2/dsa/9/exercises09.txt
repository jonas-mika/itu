Exercises 9 - Strings, Radix Sort and Quicksort

1. Tracing Quicksort
-----------------------------
Quicksort is a fast, in-place, recursive, comparable algorithm that has a good-performing average case.
It is based on the idea of partitioning an array, which means to reorder the array in a way that the for some pivot element
all element that are smaller are to the left of the pivot element and all elements larger are to the right. This ensures
that the pivot element is at its final (sorted) position in the array after the partitioning.
