==== EXERCISE 02, FIRST YEAR PROJECT 2021, PROJECT 1

Doing this exercise is doing work for your submission. You do not have to finish all the points listed below within the exercise time of 2 hours! Use the exercise time to start (with help from TAs), and then finish everything within 2 days together with your group. The next exercise will build on that.

Problem 1)
Write a pipeline that turns a csv file into a tsv file (replace all commas by tabs)

cat in.csv | tr "," "\t" > out.csv

Problem 2)
Imagine you have four folders in your current directory called: aarhus, newyork, hillerod, copenhagen
These folders contain data about these cities - the bigger the city the more data.
Running the following pipeline, what will the file "cities.txt" contain *exactly*?
du | sort -h | awk '{print $2}' | nl -w 2 -n ln > 'cities.txt'

We first sort the directories by their memory size 




MISSING DATA
- Go back to your analysis from Exercise 01, and check/fix/report how you are dealing with missing data, for example by using a MaskedArray which you learned earlier today.


FORMULATE AN OPEN RESEARCH QUESTION FOR TASK 4 FROM THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION, FILTER DATA
- In your group, brainstorm a possible research question. In particular, make decisions on which fields you will keep, how you deal with missing data, etc.
- You will need to restrict the data set to your city. Try to find out how. Hint: You will need to find an external data set somewhere to do that, making use of the field LSOA_of_Accident_Location
- After that, create a new data set in the folder /data/interim, where you keep only the fields and rows that will be relevant for your research question. Keep the raw data unchanged at all times!
