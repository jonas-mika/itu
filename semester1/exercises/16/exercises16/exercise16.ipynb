    "\n",
    "Write a script to simulate a complete game of \"war\" with two players.  \n",
    "The full rules are as follows:\n",
    "- The two players get dealt half the deck each. Each player should begin the game with 26 cards in their pile.\n",
    "- A round is played. The person who has the higher card value wins the cards played in the round.\n",
    "- If the round is a tie, players put the tied cards -- as well as three additional cards each from the top of their piles -- in the 'ante' and play another round. The winner of this round also wins all cards in the 'ante'.\n",
    "- Cards won go on the bottom of the winning player's pile.\n",
    "- The order of the cards when they go to the bottom of a player's pile is arbitrary. You may shuffle them if you like.\n",
    "- The players keep playing rounds until one player has *all* the cards and thus wins the game.\n",
    "- If there is a tie, and a player has too few cards to do the ante (and flip a new card after), they lose the game.\n",
